            "| **Real‑time user experiences** | Chatbots, virtual assistants, and search‑assist features can respond instantly, keeping conversations natural and users engaged. |\n",
            "| **Higher conversion & satisfaction** | Immediate, personalized answers reduce friction in buying or support flows, leading to higher conversion rates and better customer confidence (as noted by Rezo.ai). |\n",
            "| **Scalable production** | Enterprises can serve millions of requests per day without massive hardware over‑provisioning, keeping operational costs low. |\n",
            "| **Cost efficiency** | Faster inference means less GPU/TPU time per query, lowering cloud‑compute bills and making LLMs viable for smaller businesses. |\n",

            "- **E‑commerce:** Quick, tailored product recommendations increase the likelihood of a purchase.  \n",
            "- **Healthcare & education:** Real‑time summarization of records or lecture notes helps professionals make faster, better‑informed decisions.  \n",
            "- **Software development:** Near‑instant code generation or bug‑fix suggestions accelerate development cycles.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Technical Drivers of Speed\n",
            "- **Optimized architectures** (e.g., transformer variants, sparsity, quantization).  \n",
            "- **Specialized hardware** like Groq’s LPU, GPUs, or ASICs that execute matrix ops with low latency.  \n",
            "- **Efficient inference libraries** (e.g., Fast‑LLM) that reduce overhead and enable batch‑size tuning.  \n",
